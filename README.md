==========

An Objective-C API for controlling Sonos Devices

This is a fork of the sonos-objc project.  The plan is to add in methods, clean up some code, and eventually port to swift
unless there is an actual public api from sonos.  

The aim of this library is to create a simple to use, yet useful API to control Sonos Devices via SOAP. It depends on AFNetworking (iOS and OS X), CocoaAsyncSocket (iOS and OS X) and XMLReader.h/m (iOS and OS X)
